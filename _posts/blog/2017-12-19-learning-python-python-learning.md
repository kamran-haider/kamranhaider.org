In this post, I will commnet on how I think Python is emerging as a teaching modality and provide a list of resources that 
I came across in the past few months that are built around this idea. I would also explore how we can uses Python to understand a concept. 

Python was the first programing language I got exposed to. This was back in 2006 when I started my masters in 
computational biology. I persume this was roughly the time when Python was beginning its march towards popularity[^1]. 
Personally, I recall it as a time when 'Should I solve problem X or automate task X, using Python, Perl or R?"
used to be a question for me. Obviously, it is not so anymore. I have relied increasingly on Python not only for
day-to-day tasks related to automation and data analysis, but also for developing computational tools for research. 

Over the past few months, I have noticed ***
It is not surprising in areas such as machine learning or artificial intelligence because some of the most popular frameworks
are developed in Python so it is a natural language of choice for training in those areas. It is however surprising that 

At the same time, Python has also become a powerful teaching tool.
