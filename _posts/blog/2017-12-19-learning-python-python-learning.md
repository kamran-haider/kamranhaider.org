In this post, I will commnet on how I think Python is emerging as a teaching modality and 
provide a list of resources that I came across in the past few months that are built around this idea. 
In order to illustrate this point, I will also give an example of how a Python-based learning approach can help us grasp 
the key ideas in a topic.

Python was the first programing language I got exposed to. This was back in 2006 when I started my masters in 
computational biology. My guess is that this was roughly the time when Python was beginning its march towards popularity[^1]. 
Personally, I recall it as a time when 'Should I solve problem X or automate task X, using Python, Perl or R?"
used to be a question for me. Eventually, Python came to dominate the data science software stack and it will continue to
do so in the near future. At the same time, Python has also become a powerful teaching tool.
