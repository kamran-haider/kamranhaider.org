I recently started working on an independent machine learning project, partly inspired by the idea
that understanding machine learning requires having a problem to work on. The development of drugs that target central 
nervous system requires crossing the blood-brain barrier, a natural mechanism for the brain to prevent
chemicals with certain properties from barging in. In a drug discovery campaign for a CNS traget, it is worthwhile knowing 
eraly on if the promising compounds can cross this barrier. 
That's where machine-learning can come in handy. My current goals are:

1/ Reproduce [MoleculeNet](http://http://moleculenet.ai/) benchmarks for the performance of a diverse set of machine learning algorithms on the 
Blood-brain barrier prediction [dataset](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci300124c).

2/ Diagnose issues leading to poor model performance on test data and develop strategies to improve performance.

In the long term, I am also interested in evaluating if deep learning neural networks can give a significant performance boost. 
The best place to see current progress is to directly go to the [notes](https://github.com/kamran-haider/bbbp_ml_study/tree/master/notes) 
or [scratch](https://github.com/kamran-haider/bbbp_ml_study/tree/master/scratch) subdirecties of the project 
[Github repository](https://github.com/kamran-haider/bbbp_ml_study). From time to time, I will post about the ongoing 
progress and results on the [blog](/home).
