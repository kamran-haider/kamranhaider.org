If not for proton-hopping, we wouldn't be alive. Indeed, a crucial step in aerobic respiration is the proton-coupled
electron transport at the mitochondrial membrane. The proteins that facilitate this process take up protons from the 
surroundings and move them across membranes. The study of proton diffusion in aqueous media and across proteins is a 
major area of research in biochemistry and molecular biophysics and also a focus of research at 
[Gunner Lab](http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~gunner/), where I work. My main project here is to calculate energetics of 
proton-hopping in relatively simple systems (such as Gramicidin channel) and in Cytochrome c Oxidase. 
The main tool in my kit is the Muti-conformer Continuum Electrostatics (MCCE) approach, which is essentially a 
Monte Carlo simulation method to model protontation state changes in biomolecules. We wish to develop an extension of 
MCCE to evaluate proton transfer paths in membrane spanning proteins like CcO to develop a complete picture of how 
protons move from one side of the membrane to the other.

I am in the process of organizing the data and code from this project into a robust and reproducible workflow. The [project repository](https://github.com/kamran-haider/ProtonHopping) is up but is being updated frequently. The notebooks subdirectory will contain key results and analysis.
