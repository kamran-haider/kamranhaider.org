If not for proton-hopping, we wouldn't be alive. Indeed, a crucial step in aerobic respiration is the proton-coupled
electron transport at the mitochondrial membrane. The proteins that facilitate this process take up protons from the 
surroundings and move them across membranes. The study of proton diffusion in aqueous media and across proteins is a 
major area of research in biochemistry and molecular biophysics and also a focus of research at 
[Gunner Lab](http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~gunner/), where I work. My main project here is to calculate energetics of 
proton-hopping in relatively simple systems (such as Gramicidin channel) and in proteins such as Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO). 
The main tool in my kit is the Multi-conformer Continuum Electrostatics (MCCE) approach, which is essentially a 
Monte Carlo simulation method to model protontation state changes in biomolecules. We wish to develop an extension of 
MCCE to evaluate proton transfer paths in membrane spanning proteins like CcO to develop a complete picture of how 
protons move from one side of the membrane to the other.

After spending few months troubleshooting, we are beginning to generate some interesting data and at the moment I am 
taking some time to organize the data and code into a robust and reproducible workflow. The project repository will be  
up soon, so stay tuned for more updates.
