I continue developing and maintaining SSTMap, which is my first complete software project. 
SSTMap is a valuable addition to an expanding set of software packages for the analysis of water molecules in 
molecular dynamics trajectories. Its main advantages are its applicability across multiple MD platforms and flexibility in
carrying out calculations in different forms (e.g., grid-based vs cluster-based, choosing all or a subset of energy, entropy
and hydrogen bonding calculations). There is still plenty of room for improvement in its API and efficiency, 
which I am working on. Stay tuned for more updates on the [project website](http://sstmap.org)
