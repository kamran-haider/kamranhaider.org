IsingPy began as a fun project to use the famous Ising model to learn and implement statistical physics algrithms.
My goals in this project are twofold:

1\ Develop efficient implementations of Monte Carlo algorithms to sample spin states and calculate macroscopic observables, such as magnetization and average energy. This is more of a textbook style approach in learning statsitcal physics with Ising model.

2\ In a more ambitious attempt at a later stage, I wish to explore the crossover of statistical physics and machine learning
using Ising model, e.g., building generative models that sample spin states, using deep learning to solve inverse ising inference problem.

So far, I have managed to write the basic [code](https://github.com/kamran-haider/isingpy/blob/master/examples/modeling_ising_magnets_first_attempt.ipynb) 
that simulates Ising models of moderate sizes and reproduces the phase 
transition at the critical temperature. Currently, I am working to implement more advanced approaches, 
such as cluster algorithms, as outlined in Chapter 5 of 
[Statistical Mechanics Algorithms and Computations](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/statistical-mechanics-9780198515364?cc=us&lang=en&) 
by Werner Krauth.

For goal 2, I am waiting to go through the convolutional neural networks course on the [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), 
which I have signed up for. I am hoping that this course will equip me with tools to build and train appropriate deep learning
models for Ising systems to solve problems such as [learning phase transitions](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4035) 
and [inverse Ising inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08466).
