Predicting displacement of water molecules from a target active-site is a worthwhile but challenging endeavor. Here, we combined inhomogeneous solvation theory (IFST) with MCSS to predict water displacement from the HSP90 active-site. While IFST alone performed better than the combined approach in predicting water displacement, the MCSS provided valuable insight into functional groups suitable for displacing the waters.
