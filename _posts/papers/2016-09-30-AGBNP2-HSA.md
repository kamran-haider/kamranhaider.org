As part of a collaboration between [Kurtzman Lab](http://www.lehman.edu/faculty/tkurtzman/), [Levy Group](https://ronlevygroup.cst.temple.edu/) and [Gallicheo Lab](http://www.compmolbiophysbc.org/), we headed to SAMPL5-blinded challenge for predicting host-guest binding affinities. This work employed BEDAM absolute free energy calculations with an implicit solvent model parameterized by IFST-based hydration site analysis. After inclduing a Debye–Hückel treatment of salt effects, calculations were in good agreemnt with the experimental results.
