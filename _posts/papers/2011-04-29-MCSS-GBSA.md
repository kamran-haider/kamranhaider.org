Inspired by the progress in fragment-based drug discovery, we resurrected MCSS, an approach for functional group mapping of protin active-sites developed in early 1990s. We modified it by including energetic terms from implicit solvent energy calculations and tested its performance in predicting binding and ranking ordering of fragments to HSP90.
