If not for proton-hopping, we wouldn't be alive. The proteins that facilitate the final steps of aerobic respiration move protons across membranes. The molecular pathways of how protons move through these proteins are unclear. Here we shed some light on them using Monte Carlo simulations and networ analysis of hydrogen bonding interactions.
