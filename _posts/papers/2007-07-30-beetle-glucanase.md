As a final year biochemistry undergrdaute, when I had decided that studying computational biology was going to be my mission for forseerable future, I wandered around faculty offices asking for a problem I could solve using whatever little bioinformatics I knew. This was the result! A faculty member, studying a cellulose-degrading enzyme from the mulberry longicorn beetle gave me the task of comparing the enzyme's sequence and structure with its homologs. We used results from the comparisons to interpret some experiments and published the analysis. In retrospect, this could have been written much better. Nevertheless, this paved way for graduate school scholarship.
