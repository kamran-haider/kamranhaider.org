As local HCV patients in Pakistan became increasingly affected by antiviral drug resistance, we set out to model the active-site mutations of NS3 protease, a key anti-HCV drug target. Using impicit-solvent binding energy calculations, we developed a protocol for resistance-profiling of promising clinical candidates. While modeling studies helped us understand the mechanism of resistance, the predictive ability of the approach was hampered potentially by binding-induced structural rearrangments.
