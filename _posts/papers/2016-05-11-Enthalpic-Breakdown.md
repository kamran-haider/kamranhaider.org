In this study, we used simple measures of water structure to characterize active-site solvation using hydration site analysis. We gained valuable insights into the behavior of water under constrined surface topographies of protein active-sites and noted that structural measures, alongside solvation thermodynamics, can be useful in evaluating water displacement for ligand optimization.
