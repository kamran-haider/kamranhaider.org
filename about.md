My name is Kamran Haider and I am a computational chemist turned data scientist based in New York. 
I have always been fascinated by the idea of using computers to improve our understanding of biology. As a computational chemist, I investigated how drugs (or other small organic molecules) bind to proteins and designed software to analyze how water molecules interact with the same surfaces where drugs bind. Along the way, I fell in love with Statistical Physics, Python and more recently Machine Learning. My definition of having a great day is when I get to use all or a subset of these to solve problems and add value to my and my colleagues' work. Luckily, as a data scientist, that happens to be every day.
When not working, I spend time with my wonderful wife, trying to understand her work in payments industry and planning how we can fit more and more travel in our busy lives, while also navigating the challenges of parenting a cute and mischievous toddler.
