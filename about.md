My name is Kamran Haider and I am a Post-doctoral Researcher at the City University of New York. 
I have always been fascinated by the idea of using computers to improve our understanding of biology. As a result, I have 
spent past decade of my life getting training (graduate studies) and doing research in the fields of Computational 
Chemistry & Biology. Along the way, I have fallen in love with Statistical Physics, Python and more recently Machine Learning. 
My definition of having a great day is when I get to use all or a subset of these to solve problems and add value to my 
and my colleague's work. When not working, I spend time with my wonderful wife, trying to understand her work in 
payments industry and planning how we can fit more and more travel in our busy lives, while also navigating the 
challenges of parenting a cute and mischievous toddler.
